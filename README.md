-#DS in JS
-
-*"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships."* - **Linus Trovaldis**
-
-This is a project which I am currently undertaking. Calling myself a JS developer I was disappointed by the lack of resources and interest people have in implementing Data Structures in JS. Hence, I decided to dive into DS using solely JS.
-
-I followed Object Oriented Programming as described in [JavaScript: The Good Parts by **Douglas Crawford**](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do).
-Also, to get a head start as to how the implementation of varios data structures happen in JS I followed [Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript] (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029557.do)
-
-##Implementation
-To implement the code, I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on the command line. However Node.js does not have a very interactive shell, therefore I moved on to [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey), which is a little hard to set up but has a richly interactive shell. Binary trees onwards I moved to SpiderMonkey.

-
-####The Project currently consists of the basic implemenation of the Following data structures:
-    1.Arrays
-    2.Lists
-    3.Stacks
-    4.Queues
-    5.Linked Lists
-    6.Dictionaries
-    7.Sets
-    8.Hash-Tables
-    9.Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (WIP)
-    10.Graphs (WIP) 
-The project also consists of some trivial problems in the misc. folder.
-
-This is still WIP and will be adding the solution to exercises mentioned after every chapter in DS with JS.
